            <p>
                My name is Srijith G Menon, and I am a student interested in data science, technology, and how data-driven tools can be applied to real-world social and interdisciplinary problems. I am particularly interested in understanding how data can be used responsibly to analyze human behavior, social systems, and complex interactions across different fields.

                <h3>Why Learning Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters because data does not exist in a vacuum. Behind every dataset involving people are real lives, experiences, and consequences. Modeling social topics allows us to better understand patterns in behavior, inequality, communication, and decision-making, but it also forces us to confront the limitations of purely technical approaches. Numbers can describe trends, but interpretation requires social awareness, ethical reasoning, and contextual understanding.

                <p>
                    Modeling people and social systems can help answer important questions, such as how resources are distributed, how information spreads, or how policies affect different groups. However, these models can also oversimplify human behavior if we are not careful. People are not just data points, and social systems are influenced by culture, history, and power structures that may not be fully captured in a dataset. This makes interdisciplinary thinking essential when working with social data.

                    With the use of data about people comes responsibility. One responsibility is protecting privacy and ensuring that individuals are not harmed or exposed through data misuse. Another is avoiding biased conclusions that reinforce stereotypes or systemic inequalities. Data scientists must think critically about where data comes from, who is represented or excluded, and how results might be used in practice. Transparency, fairness, and accountability are key responsibilities when working with social data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this course, I hope to better understand how data science tools can be applied thoughtfully to social questions. I want to learn how to analyze data while considering ethical implications and real-world impact. I am especially interested in gaining skills that allow me to communicate findings clearly and responsibly, making data-driven insights accessible and meaningful beyond purely technical audiences.

                <p>Another reason learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters is because data-driven tools often influence real decisions that affect people’s lives. Models are used to shape policies, recommend actions, and predict outcomes, which means mistakes or oversights can have real consequences. This has made me realize that building an accurate model is not always enough. It’s just as important to think about the assumptions behind the data and what might be missing from it. A model might perform well technically but still lead to unfair results if social context is ignored. Through this course, I hope to become more comfortable questioning results, recognizing limitations, and thinking carefully about how data-driven conclusions impact different groups of people.</p>
